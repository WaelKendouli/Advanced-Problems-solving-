5 : Traffic Signal System Simulation
Problem: Simulate vehicles waiting at a traffic signal.

Vehicles are processed in the order they arrive (FIFO), and after processing, the next vehicle moves up.

Vehicles arrive in the following order:

"Car 1";
"Truck 1"
"Bike 1"
"Bus 1"



Output:

Traffic Signal Simulation Started...


Car 1 has passed the signal.

Vehicles waiting: Truck 1, Bike 1, Bus 1

Truck 1 has passed the signal.

Vehicles waiting: Bike 1, Bus 1

Bike 1 has passed the signal.

Vehicles waiting: Bus 1

Bus 1 has passed the signal.

Ticketing System Simulation
Problem: Simulate a ticketing system where customers are served in the order they arrive. When a customerâ€™s ticket is processed, the next ticket is queued for service.

Output:

Ticket 101 issued.

Ticket 102 issued.

Ticket 103 issued.

Ticket 104 issued.

Ticket 105 issued.


Ticketing System Simulation Started...

Processing Ticket: 101

Remaining Tickets: 102, 103, 104, 105

Processing Ticket: 102

Remaining Tickets: 103, 104, 105

Processing Ticket: 103

Remaining Tickets: 104, 105

Processing Ticket: 104

Remaining Tickets: 105

Processing Ticket: 105

No more tickets in the queue.

Ticketing System Simulation Ended


No vehicles waiting.

Traffic Signal Simulation Ended.
